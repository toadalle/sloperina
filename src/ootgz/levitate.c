/* Levitate and 2x speed: both move Link through his physics record.
 *
 * Link's position lives in a physics record: doubles (x, y, z) 0.585 above his drawn position,
 * followed by motion state the game ignores the position without (FINDINGS §5.9-§5.15). game.py found
 * the record by searching the heap and test-moving the look-alikes (moving the wrong one once broke
 * the camera). Here the search starts from Link's actor instead: follow its pointers a few levels
 * deep, a few hundred objects per frame, collect records that match his position, then test-lift
 * each (kept only if his drawn position follows; put back at once otherwise). The pointer path to the
 * one that works is logged, so a later version can go straight to it.
 *
 * Hover: L3 toggles it, R3 toggles ghost collision while hovering, X rises, B descends,
 * and releasing both holds altitude. The left stick moves him
 * relative to the camera. Walls: the game pushes
 * Link back out of them between our writes; a push-back is a move against his heading (after he has
 * held it for a moment, or the momentum of a turn looks like one), and it marks the wall for a
 * moment so we stop pushing into it (FINDINGS §5.10). "through walls" now requests the
 * controller's ForceNoHit mode and sets position through its own API (cct.c), rather
 * than only undoing push-back. Other movement retains the floor/wall correction logic.
 *
 * 2x speed: while Link walks or runs on the stick, add the distance the game moved him this frame
 * again (the game's collision still pushes him back out of walls).
 *
 * Walk through walls: once the stick has pushed Link the same way for a moment while he barely moves,
 * his controller's collision is switched off (cct.c, the game's ForceNoHit, as levitate's through
 * walls) and he's walked on that way (relative to the camera, as levitate steers) at his running speed
 * and at the height he was at, through the controller's own position setter, until the stick is let
 * go or turned; then his collision comes back and his landing is protected, as after a float. Writing
 * the physics record alone doesn't work: the game's collision puts him back at the wall every frame
 * (FINDINGS §8). Floors don't hold him up meanwhile, hence the held height. */

/* Save / load position (gz).
 *
 * Saving reads Link's drawn position, his facing and the map. Moving him back goes through his
 * physics record (levitate.c), which has to be found first in each area: a heap scan that test-lifts
 * the matches, a second or two. The first save (or load) in an area starts that search and says so
 * ("Locating Link's start position"), rather than acting later out of the blue; the next press works.
 * Saving needs the record so that the load after it is instant.
 *
 * A load waits for both shortcut buttons to be released. "loading position" shows at once, as "position saved" does (saving only reads, so
 * it doesn't wait), and "position loaded" when he's there. It's then checked: done once
 * Link is drawn there; otherwise written again a few times, and if it never takes, the record is put
 * back where Link is (so it isn't "lost" and searched for again). */
